![Digibooky logo](digibooky.png)

Digibooky is going to revolutionize the classic libraries. Users will come to the VR offices where VR headsets are available. 
Using these VR headsets, users can roam Digibooky's digital library, where they can make their preferred selection of books to borrow.

The front end of Digibooky will run on the VR enabled computer. 
It'll be developed in a later stadium by a company specialized in VR applications.

The front-end of Digibooky will communicate with the back end of Digibooky through a REST(ful) web API (over HTTP(s)), 
using JSON as its message format. This back end will contain the entire domain and all the business logic.
It's your job to implement this back-end.

## Technical requirements for JAVA

- Create a new GitHub repository (one per team)
- Provide a REST(ful) web API (with JSON as the message / body format)
- Use Spring Boot (latest release)
- Use Maven
- Setup a Jenkins or Travis for continuous integration
    - We'll help you with this...
- Perform logging (use spring-boot-starter's logging dependencies: logback and slf4j)
    - Certainly log all interactions with the application that can be defined as "errors"
        - E.g.: unauthorized access, illegal arguments, exceptions in general,...
- Include OpenAPI using Swagger(UI) to provide a readable documentation/manual of your REST(ful) web API
- Use Lists or HashMaps to store your data (fake in-memory database).
    - Store them in a specific class / classes (e.g. `AutherTable` or `DigibookyDatabase`)
    - (You can also try to store it in files, but that's not recommended)
- (This only applies when ORM/JPA has been seen): use JPA (Hibernate / EclipseLink) in combination with PostgreSQL or Oracle to store and access the data in a persistent way
    - Correctly setup and handle the transactions.

## Technical requirements for .NET

- Create a new GitHub repository (one per team)
- Provide a REST(ful) web API (with JSON as the message / body format)
- Use ASP.NET Core Web Api
- Use AzureDevops for continuous integration
    - We'll help you with this
- Perform logging (use logging provided by .NET Core)
    - Certainly log all interactions with the application that can be defined as "errors"
        - E.g.: unauthorized access, illegal arguments, exceptions in general,...
- Include OpenAPI using Swagger(UI) to provide a readable documentation/manual of your REST(ful) web API
- Use Lists or HashMaps to store your data (fake in-memory database).
    - Store them in a specific class / classes (e.g. `AutherTable` or `DigibookyDatabase`)
    - (You can also try to store it in files, but that's not recommended)
- (This only applies when ORM has been seen): Use Entity Framework instead of in memory Lists,...  

## Architectural Setup

Provide a multi-module setup where each module (not package) represents a 'layer'.
- Although a Layered architecture might no be the best architecture (for big projects), when used properly(!), it is actually 
a nice way of separating concerns in your code. Read the following links:
    - https://www.codingthearchitecture.com/2016/04/25/layers_hexagons_features_and_components.html
    - http://www.codingthearchitecture.com/2015/03/08/package_by_component_and_architecturally_aligned_testing.html
- We're proposing 5 layers: war (top-level), api, service, domain and infrastructure (lowest-level)
    - But, at the very least provide an api, service and domain module.
    - The war module can be used to package together the whole application (also contains the Main Class)
    - The infrastructure can be used to contain code on which all other modules can depend.
    
Furthermore, use DTO's for encapsulating the payload of a request or of a response to/of your web API. 
(and ideally a different DTO for the request and for the response of a call to your web API)

## Functional Stories

The functional requirements are written down as stories. 

- The functional analyst will be available to answer all your questions (he'll speak for the customer Digibooky)
- The functional analyst made some design decisions, if you want to challenge those, you always can. Come prepared though. :grin:

### Story 5: Search a book by author
As a user I want to search for a book by entering a part of the author so I can efficiently find a specific book. 
I should be able to enter wildcards if I don't know the complete name of the author. It should be possible to use 
only the first name, only the last name or both.
- Prioritization: Must-Have

### Story 6A: Register as member
As a user I want to be able to register myself as a new Digibooky member so I can perform additional actions. 
This member should have a unique INSS (social security number), last name, first name, e-mail, street name, street number, postal code and city. 
- A member should contain a unique user identification number (create your own, don't use INSS)
- The INSS should be filled in and unique.

    - Also validate that the e-mail is of the form `x@x.x`, where x can be any type and amount of 
    letters and numbers.
- The last name and city should be filled in.
- Out of scope: validation of the postal code and the city.

### Story 17: Overdue Fines
As a librarian I want to create a fine when a member returns a book that is overdue so I can penalize this behavior.
- The maximum loan period is 3 weeks
- The formula to calculate the fine is: `€5 + €2 * FULL_WEEKS_OVERDUE`
    - E.g.
        - 3 weeks: no fine

- Try to suggest some additional data to your customer that could be useful for inclusion in the report.
- Prioritization: Nice-To-Have

## DigibookyFin (Nice-To-Have)
DigibookyFin is a stand-alone application that runs on a different port and has its own GitHub repository.
It handles the financial administration of Digibooky, in essence it allows for the generation and sending of invoices.

This is an optional application, make sure Digibooky is working properly before starting with DigibookyFin.

### Story 1: 
As an accountant I want to generate an invoice for a certain member so that I can add this invoice as an attachment to an e-mail.
- The unique user identification number should be provided to identify the member
- The invoice should contain the complete information about the member (full name + address) and all its unpaid fines.
    - This member and fine information should be requested (Digibooky contains this information)
    - DigibookyFin should not store any member or fine information (besides their unique identification numbers)
- The first invoice of a member always contains the subscription fee of €15.

### Story 2:
As an accountant I want to get an overview of the invoices generated for a member.
- The overview should show for each invoice the unique invoice number, the full name of the member and the total amount of the invoice.

### Story 3:
As an accountant I want to mark an invoice as paid so I can keep track of which invoices are paid and which are not.

## Possible expansions
1. Digibooky can offer e-books, DVD's or any other media.
